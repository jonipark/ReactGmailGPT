## GmailGPT

The email prompt specifies the subject or purpose of the email. Here are a few examples of possible prompts:

- Write an email that confirms my interview availability this Friday at 2pm
- Write an email that requests an extension for my philosophy midterm paper.
- Write an email that informs my team about a change in the scheduled meeting time.
- Write an email to schedule a follow-up meeting after a client presentation.

By providing these prompts, users can receive a basic outline for their email. We are also aware that the tone of the email should depend on the context and the recipient. Currently, we offer the tones: concise, professional, confident, nice, passionate, apologetic. The user can choose one or more tones that best align with their intentions. GmailGPT then leverages the chosen tones and prompts to generate a customized email suited to the user's needs.
